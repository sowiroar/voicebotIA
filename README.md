## Introduction
This voicebot project integrates advanced AI capabilities to provide seamless, conversational interactions. By combining the power of OpenAI's language model with ElevenLabs' text-to-speech technology and Flask for backend processing, the bot can understand natural language queries and respond audibly.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Uses OpenAI to understand and generate human-like responses.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts text responses to speech using ElevenLabs.
- **Backend Services**: Built on Flask, providing a robust and scalable API.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Processes user queries and responds in real time.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sowiroar/voicebotIA.git
   cd voicebotIA
